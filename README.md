This project delves into the analysis of sentiments and emotions expressed in real-time Reddit comments. Utilizing website APIs, we gather live data and leverage machine learning to decipher the underlying attitudes and feelings within user comments.

Our Approach:
Data Collection: Employing Reddit's API, we harvest comments associated with specific posts.
Sentiment Analysis: A machine learning model predicts comment sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, achieving an impressive 96.8% accuracy with a stacking ensemble model.
Emotion Analysis: Additionally, the system identifies six different emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc.) from comments, again reaching 96.8% accuracy.
Project Impact:
The extracted insights into user attitudes and emotions unlock valuable potential for various applications, such as:

Market Research: Understanding customer sentiment towards brands and products.
Brand Monitoring: Tracking online brand perception and reputation.
Social Media Management: Tailoring content and strategies based on audience emotions.
Future Directions:
Enhanced Emotional Analysis: Explore neural networks and deep learning for improved accuracy.
Incorporating User/Subreddit Data: Refine predictions by considering user profiles and subreddit dynamics.
Cross-Platform Expansion: Develop a generalized model applicable to various social media platforms.
Real-Time Monitoring: Integrate analysis into a monitoring system for continuous sentiment tracking.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the power of machine learning in analyzing real-time Reddit data. By deciphering user sentiment and emotions, we pave the way for valuable insights across various domains. Looking forward, we envision advancements in model accuracy, broader platform applicability, and real-world monitoring systems for enhanced understanding of online discourse.
